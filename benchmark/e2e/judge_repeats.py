"""Judging each question several times, to see how much the RAGAS score moves.

The judge is an LLM, so faithfulness and answer relevancy change between runs on
byte-identical answers (see REPRODUCIBILITY.md). With `judge_repeats: N`, each
metric scores every question N times. The recorded score is the mean of the
draws, and the spread of the draws is written next to it, per question, so the
noise of the judge can be read off the results instead of guessed.

Retrieval and generation still run once: the answer being judged is fixed and
only the measurement repeats.

Kept out of harness/: the harness is product-agnostic and calls RAGAS once, so
the repetition belongs to the metric objects the e2e benchmark hands it.
